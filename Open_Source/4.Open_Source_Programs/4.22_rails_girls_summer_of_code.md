<h1>What you need to Apply?</h1>

### A teammate
A team requires 2 students working from the same city, so you’ll need to find someone to pair with before submitting your application.

It is important that you can work well together. You will be working very closely for three months, planning team goals together, and the first line of support for one another.

For further information on finding a teammate we have prepared a detailed guide for you.

### Coaches
Coaches are developers who sit down with you, guide you through relevant coding steps and troubleshoot with you at regular intervals. Ideally they are based in the same city as your team.

We recommend 4-8 hours per week of coaching time. This requires a minimum of 2 coaches so they can share the time commitment, and provide you and your teammate with more flexible support.

Our guide for coaches will help to give you insight on what is required of them, and help you to explain this to prospective coaches. For further information on how to find coaches, we have also prepared a a detailed guide.

### A place to work
You will need an environment suitable for working on your project for 3 months. This could be your home, a co-working space, your current work office or a coaching company. As long as you are safe and productive, you can choose where you will work.

If you’re not able to find a coaching company or coworking space, universities can also be a good option.

Working at a desk next to your teammate and coaches is beneficial. Having access to a team of coaches who can share the load is ideal.

### The ability to self-manage and motivate
This is a very important point. You will have time with your coaches each week but, as the program is self-guided, there will not be someone telling you what to do for the entire duration of the project.

As a team, you will be required to define your goals for the program, and plan together how you will meet these goals. We are always here to help you with this planning, but it’s up to you to stick to your plan and achieve your goals.
